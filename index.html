      <h2>How to set tones in Itende Music Style in Roland E-09?</h2>
      <p>Before everything you need to understand and be able to differentiate types of tones and when to play them and
        how you do you set them and finally playing them. There are tones for worship, praise, praying and preachers. So
        in this blog you get information on how to set tones for each specific moment in when you are in a church or
        event where you play itende music style. Below we start by the mostly used keyboard across south Africa when
        playing Itende music style, and that keyboard is Roland E-09 which is modern and also an alternative if you
        can’t afford or unable to get vintage Roland e-series models.</p>
      <div class="row">

        <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12">

        </div>

      </div>
      <h2>Roland E-09 Itende Basic Tone Fully Explained.</h2>
      <p>Firstly, you need set Main Tone and you do it by pressing or switching on the Tone button, secondly press or
        switch on the numeric button or I can say the button with text numeric written below it then now you can punch
        in <b>390 (Bass&Lead)</b> after doing so then you need to octave your tone to negative 1 (-1), how do you do
        that? Press function and navigate to octave using under SELECT text arrow buttons near use program button. When
        you get there then the keyboard program will automatically enter into octave menu and first li is what we are
        looking for MAIN OCTAVE which defaults to 0 when the keyboard is switched on every time then now you need to use
        plus (+) button/ yes (to increase) and minus (-) no (to decrease) and for now we are going to use minus button
        in order to make MAIN OCTAVE to -1 that results in making the tones sound more low than high. We have done this
        because we are still going to set our dual Tone which is going to give use that high sound. </p>
      <p>Secondly, you need to set Dual Tone and you do it by pressing and holding the dual button then press or switch
        on the numeric button or I can say the button with text numeric written above it then punch in <b>398
          (Brightness) </b> while holding the dual button after that then you have mixed your tones and you can release
        the dual button but that’s not the end we need to octave the dual tone to positive (1+), again you press
        function button and navigate to octave then when it automatically enters octave menu you need to navigate to the
        right using buttons under SELECT text, then you will see Dual OCTAVE then you need to press minus button to set
        it to positive one (+1). </p>
      <p>Thirdly, you need to balance you tones volumes but in this case we need to decrease dual tone’s volume, then
        you press function and navigate to volumes and after automatically entering in volumes menu then navigate to the
        right you will see Dual volume and use yes / plus (+) button to increase and no/minus button to decrease for now
        we are decreasing the dual volume, decrease the volume to 75 then we are finally done setting Itende in Roland
        E-09. </p>
      <p>Finally, push the modulation forward and insert a paper or something not harmful. This action is called
        modulating, Itende is always modulated across all keyboards it’s based on modulation actually without modulation
        it won’t sound as proper Itende Sound. After modulating your mixture, you can now start playing and hear how
        good is the Itende sound is produced by your settings you just set on your keyboard. </p>
      <b> NOTE: THE SHORTCUT OF Inserting Dual, setting Octave and decreasing the volume is this: press & hold dual then
        punch in 398 while holding press yes/plus to increase dual then use buttons under the keyboards volume knob to
        increase or decrease the volume of dual. You can also decrease the main tone’s octave using this shortcut by
        pressing and holding Tone button then pressing no/minus to decrease octave to -1 and you can decrease the main
        tone’s volume using balance keyboard buttons under the Volume Knob. </b>
      <b> Roland E-09 Itende Chorus Settings. </b>
      <p>1. Using the knowledge, you already have on how to set the main tone and set the dual tone, in this paragraph I
        will teach you to set alternative mixes for itende when playing praise songs. Praise songs are songs where the
        song’s tempo is quick. First alternative is <b> 390 (Lead&Bass) </b> as Main Tone and mixed with <b> 377
          (Distsquare) </b> as Dual. After Completing that, now press function and navigate to octave and make main tone
        octave -1 and make dual tone octave 0. After setting octaves then it’s time for setting volumes leave the main
        tone’s volume at 127 and set dual tone’s volume to 75 then that’s it, move on. <p>

          <p>Second alternative is mixing <b> 390 (Lead&Bass</b>) as Main Tone Octave (-1) and mixed with <b> 378
              (Natural Ld) </b> as Dual Octave (0) Dual Volume 75, another alternative is mixing <b> 390 (Lead&Bass)
            </b> as Main Tone Octave (-1) and mixed with <b> 378 (Cheese Org) </b> as Dual Octave (0) and Dual Volume
            75. </p>
          <h5> Roland E-09 Itende Plain Strings. </h5>
          <p>Mix <b> 218 (St.Strings) </b> as Main Tone, Octave (-1) then you are good to go.</br>
            Alternative Mix <b> 224 (XP Strings) </b> as Main Tone, Octave (-1) then you are good to go.</br>
            Alternative Mix <b> 239 (Strings 2) </b> as Main Tone, Octave (-1) then you are good to go. </p>

          <h2>Introduction into Splitting Tone before we continue for Touching Soul Tones</h2>
          <p>Splitting tones is one of the most importance things you must be able to do in your keyboard, but before we
            go far we need to understand what is splitting and why do we use split or why do we split tones. Splitting
            tones is used to play two different tone one on the right and one on the left which is quite different from
            dual. Splitting tones in Roland E-09 is limited because you can only split two plain tone on each side but
            other keyboards allow you to dual tones and split again of which is so cool. Coming back to Roland E-09 now
            we are going to focus on learning how to split tones, without wasting more time start by pressing and
            switching on main tone and press and switch on numeric button after doing so then start punching in <b> 218
              St. strings </b> and press function and navigate to octave and make it -1 after doing so we need to press
            and switch on the split button then punch in <b> 277 Violin 1</b> and set it’s octave to 0 or -1 then
            navigate to keyboard settings li then in the menu you navigate again to split point and increase to set what
            effect does that make after doing so then you can also play around with split hold to see which is
            comfortable with you. That’s the summary about splitting in Roland E-09 model. </p>

          <h2>Splitting Combination for Touching souls.</h2>
          <p>Mix <b> 218 (St. Strings) </b> as Main Tone Octave -1 and <b> 277 (Violin 1) as</b> Split Tone, Octave
            0/-1, Split Volume 100 -127.</br>
            Mix <b> 218 (St. Strings) </b> as Main Tone Octave -1 and<b> 295 (Pan Flute) as </b> Split Tone, Octave
            0/-1, Split Volume 100 -127.</br>
            Mix <b> 218 (St. Strings) </b> as Main Tone Octave -1 and</b> 287 (Hyper Alto) as </b> Split Tone, Octave
            0/-1, Split Volume 100 -127.</br>
            Mix <b> 218 (St. Strings) </b> as Main Tone Octave -1 and<b> 305 (BottleBlow) as</b> Split Tone, Octave
            0/-1, Split Volume 100 -127.</br>
            Then we are done about Roland E-09 Itende Tones and Other Tones used in Itende, In the next part you’ll
            learn about which beats are the best for itende using Roland E-09. </p>
          <h2>Setting Beats in Roland E-09 for Itende </h2>
          <p>In this chapter I will teach you how to set beats for different song rhythms, there are many different
            types of song rhythms. There is worship songs –faster and slow songs- and praise songs –fast and slow
            praise- as written above. Set the tempo ranging between 40-49 it depends on the singer’s pace, how to do it?
            To set a beat for slow worship you must press Styles button / switch it on and then press / switch on
            numeric button finally punch in <b> 24 Temp_Pop then using – and + buttons then you can decrease or increase
              the tempo</b>. When you want alternative beats you can use the following beats: </p>
          <ol>
            <li> 25 FriendBeat </li>
            <li> 27 Soul Bal </li>
            <li> 30 AlClapBl</li>
            <li> 38 FateBeat</li>
            <li> 39 Easy Pop</li>
          </ol>
          <!-- 
1.	25 FriendBeat 
2.	27 Soul Bal
3.	30 AlClapBl
4.	38 FateBeat
5.	39 Easy Pop -->
          <p>Getting into faster worship aka blues beats you must set the tempo ranging between 55-65 but as I said
            earlier that depends to the singer’s pace. Note that you can also use tap tempo to determine the song tempo
            but that does always work precisely therefore you need to set it after using tap tempo also. The following
            are beats -Number and Name respectively- can be used to play beats for songs flowing in blues rhythms.
            Faster Worship Beats for Songs flowing on blue beats</p>
          <ol>
            <li> 6 USBallad <b> (mostly used) </b> </li>
            <li> 67 Blues <b> (mostly used) </b> </li>
            <li> 68 70s R&B</li>
            <li> 74 Cool 6_8</li>
            <li> 75 Oldie6_8</li>
          </ol>

2.	67 Blues <b> (mostly used) </b>
3.	68 70s R&B
4.	74 Cool 6_8
5.	75 Oldie6_8 -->
          <p>Getting into setting beats for Fast Praise songs or aka Chorus songs, these type of songs need you set
            tempo to range between 125-145 but again I stress the point of noting the singers pace before setting the
            beat. Remember you can always use Tap Tempo to determine the tempo of the song. The following are beats
            (Number and Name) respectively are good for fast praise songs.

          <p>Getting into Mixing Beats while playing the chorus or praise songs for excitement. Note these beats are
            uses fill ins and intros then later change back to the beat you were using earlier exactly like deejays when
            they interrupt/mix songs but in a nice and smooth transition between songs way. The following are beats that
            you can use to perform what I just taught you about. Before using these beats, it is important first to lock
            tempo. How do you do that? Press and hold numeric and press MELODY INTELLIGENCE and you’ll see in the screen
            writing locked and the button MELODY INTELLIGENCE will switch on. After completing all this you are good to
            go. </p>

          <h1>Roland E-16</h1>
          <div class="row">
            <h2>Roland E-16</h2>
            <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12">
              <img src="img/e16.jpg" style="width:auto; height:auto" alt="Roland E-16" />
            </div>
          </div>
          <h2>Intro</h2>
          <p>Roland E-16 is one of the mostly used keyboards in Itende music Industry because of it’s Nice and powerful
            Fretless Bass. This keyboard is very powerful and it’s very good when playing praise songs also worship
            songs but it’s the best when it comes to praise in Itende Music therefore you need to know where is your
            keyboard good at and how to get the best out of it.</p>
          <h2>How to set Itende </h2>
          <p>Looking at under “tone” text written in big font in the keyboard there are buttons from 1 to 9 and at the
            left of button number 1 there is a white button having a text Group over it, press it and switch it to A
            group of tones then punch in<b> 54 Fretless Bs. </b>But before all you need to press select and switch it to
            upper tone which is your main tone and lowers as your splitting tone. In Roland E-16 there is no dual tone
            so this means you can only play one full tone at a time except if you want to split tones then play two tone
            but separately but not mixed into one tone as other keyboards that allow dual function. After pressing<b> 54
              Fretless Bs. </b>Then you have successfully set Itende in Roland E-16 and now you need to put a small pick
            in then modulation button (Big Triangle Button) insert the small pick at the right of the triangle button.
          </p>
          <h5>Strings</h5>
          <p>When you setting strings, you will do the very same things as you have done when setting Itende Tone. The
            following are string tones that can be used on prayer or preaching.
            Use<b> 71 Strings (A71) </b>at group A or <b>72 Slow Strings (A72) </b>at group A.</p>

          <h5>Synth Bass </h5>
          <p>This is the famous Tone which was loved by the Late Pastor NJ Sithole, In Roland E-16 it can be found in
            group A and number<b> 57 Synth Bass 1 (A57).</b></p>
